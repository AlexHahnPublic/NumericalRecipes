# Numerical Methods

Interface files for python and matlab call methods with raw fast compiled C++ Code

Hesitant to git add the source C++ or even the machine readable code as Numerical Recipes has very ... interesting copy right laws (can use 5 method's/ algo's raw on one "Screen" (can't distribute), more than that is copyright infringement apparently). Will talk to Saul and see what's appropriate.

Will probably just implement in python (or own C++) and import as a module when needed
